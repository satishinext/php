    /// 100 items. <i>BatchGetItem</i> will return a partial result if the response size limit
    /// is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing
    /// failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for
    /// <i>UnprocessedKeys</i>. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with
    /// the next item to get.
